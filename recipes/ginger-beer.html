    <H2>Simple and Spicy to help your throat and Tummy</H2>
      <p>I had started making this with the intentions on making it alcoholic, which I have been able to ferment once or twice.  It usually gets drank by the Wife and Neice before it gets that Chance.  This can also be blended up with some frozen Strawberries to make the Famous <em>'Ginger Berry Cooler'</em></p>
