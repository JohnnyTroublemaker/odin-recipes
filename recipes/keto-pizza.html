    <H1>Keto Pizza</H1>
    <img src="../img/keto-pizza.jpg" alt="Low Carb Delicious Pizza fit for the Ketogenic Diet">
    <H2>The Crust is mostly made of Cheese... Mostly</H2>
    <p>This recipe comes straight from Ruled.me when I was heavy into my keto diet.  It did make me loose weight and it was quite delicious.  If I make my own pizza, this is it.</p>
    <H3>STUFF</H3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups (~8 oz.) mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li> ¾ cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon psyllium husk powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (~1.5 oz.) cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
      </ul>
    <H3>STEPS</H3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400F. Measure out 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and put into a microwave safe bowl. This is about 8 oz. of cheese.</li>
        <li>Microwave the cheese until fully melted and pliable. Try not to have any more browning than the picture indicates (browned cheese will go hard). This took me ~90 seconds. Add 3 tbsp. cream cheese and 1 egg to the cheese and mix it in well.</li>
        <li>Add 3/4 cup almond flour, 1 tbsp. psyllium husk powder, 1 tbsp. Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp. salt and pepper to the cheese mixture and mix together.</li>
        <li>As you mix the dough, it should become cool enough to work with your hands. Knead the dough together until you can form a round ball.</li>
        <li>Plop the ball onto a silpat (these are awesome, by the way) with 1 tsp. olive oil to keep it easy to work with. Press the dough out with your hands, forming a circular pattern as you press outward.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 10 minutes on one side and remove from the oven. I prefer to bake the pizza on an upside down cookie sheet – this allows for the pizza to spread out slightly without being constricted or contorted by the edges of the cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Flip the pizza to the other side and bake for another 2-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and top with toppings of your choice (in this case: 1/2 cup Rao’s tomato sauce, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and 16 slices pepperoni).</li>
        <li>Bake again for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until cheese is nicely melted.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly, cut into slices, and serve. Optionally, sprinkle oregano over the top!</li>
       </ol>
